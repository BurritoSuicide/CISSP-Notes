- Do at least 100 questions a day.
- Think like a manager
  1.) Think like a manager.
  2.) If one choice wins over others, that is likely the answer (if I were to do one of these actions, which one is best).
  3.) If you are going with that choice, YOU ARE NOT DOING THE OTHER ACTIONS.
  4.) Justify your answer.
  5.) Don't add information to the question.
  6.) Read everything carefully, take a little bit of time and breathe (do not add scenarios into questions).

As an example:
  - What is most important to consider when storing personally identifiable information about customers?
    A.) Encryption Methods
    B.) Laws and regulations
    C.) Data Location
    D.) Access controls

Answer: B.
  - Why? Laws and regulations are more of a managerial answer. Additionally, laws and regulations answer **ALL** other answers.
