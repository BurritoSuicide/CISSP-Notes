General notes:
  - Think like a manager.
  - If one choice wins over others, that is likely the answer (if I were to do one of these actions, which one is best).
  - If you are going with that choice, YOU ARE NOT DOING THE OTHER ACTIONS.
  - Justify your answer.
  - Don't add information to the question.
  - Read everything carefully, take a little bit of time and breathe (do not add scenarios into questions).
  - Do at least 100 questions a day.

As an example:
  - What is most important to consider when storing personally identifiable information about customers?
    A.) Encryption Methods
    B.) Laws and regulations
    C.) Data Location
    D.) Access controls

Answer: B.
  - Why? Laws and regulations are more of a managerial answer. Additionally, laws and regulations answer **ALL** other answers.
